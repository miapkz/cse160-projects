Homework 2

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file and your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 0: Setup

0.4302926296296296

Problem 1: Remove some lines

When I commented out 'total_count = 0', the program couldn't run because 'total_count' was not defined. 
If I commented out 'nucleotides = filename_to_string(file_name)', then the file couldn't be read in, and later, when 'nucleotides' appear in a for loop, an error would say 'nucleotides' aren't defined.

Problem 2: Compute AT Content

AT-content: 0.5694001293886175

Problem 3: Count nucleotides

G-count: 1
C-count: 2
A-count: 5
T-count: 2

Problem 4: Sanity-check the data

All the files have the same value for total count and length of nucleotides, but a different, smaller value for the sum of G, C, A and T. One reason for this could be that the DNA has mutations, so not all the nucleotides have one of those letters. For example, when looking through sample 1, we can see that some lines of nucleotides contain the letter 'N'.
To calculate GC content, we should use the sum of G, C, A and T counts in the denominator. This is because we are calculating the percentage of G and C nucleotides out of G, C, A and T, not potential mutations.

Problem 5: Compute the AT/GC ratio

AT/GC Ratio: 1.3239998343934933

Problem 6: Categorize organisms

GC Classification: moderate
